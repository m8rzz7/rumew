        <p>
          The visual essay showcases the beauty of the nature the sprouts up through out the somewhat <a href="https://www.niche.com/places-to-live/new-brunswick-middlesex-nj/" target="_blank">urban</a> environment of <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">Rutgers-New Brunswick</a>. Most of these trees are surrounded by large buildings, where other trees and plants once stood. The placement of these trees is planned and particular. Yet despite the oddly ironic unnatural circumstances of the trees on campus, the presence of them provides a refreshing reminder of nature. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The trees on campus have provided me shade to rest under, a structure to climb, and flowers to share with friends. <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/how-forests-store-carbon#:~:text=Trees%20are%20without%20a%20doubt,wood%2C%20branches%2C%20and%20roots." target="_blank">Most importantly</a>, they keep us and our planet alive by producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide. Nonetheless, trees are such an ordinary object in everyone's life that they often go unnoticed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This visual essay serves as an exploration into the extraordinary elements that are nestled within the ordinary aspects of life. It aims to draw attention to the often-overlooked beauty of urban trees that punctuate our concrete jungles, standing as silent yet powerful testimonies to the natural world. This project is not just a collection of images; it is an invitation extended to the viewer. It encourages one to pause in their busy lives, to take a moment to observe and truly see the world around them. It serves as a reminder of the resilience and stunning beauty of nature, which persists and thrives amidst the concrete, steel, and glass of our urban landscapes. This essay demonstrates that even in the most unlikely of places, nature finds a way to assert its presence and leave us in awe of its enduring spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the course of this essay, my aim is to ignite a spark of wonder and foster an appreciation for the natural elements that exist harmoniously alongside us in our urban environments. This narrative attempts to capture the unspoken dialogue that takes place between the forces of nature and urbanization. It serves as a gentle reminder that our relationship with our environment is reciprocal - as much as we leave our imprint on our surroundings, nature, in return, shapes us in ways more profound and subtle than we often realize.
        </p>
        <p>
          This intricate interplay between the natural and built environment is something that we often overlook in the hustle and bustle of city life. However, it significantly influences our well-being and sense of place. From the air we breathe to the aesthetic appeal of our neighborhoods, nature plays a pivotal role in urban living.
        </p>

          The images start off with the blooming pink trees emblematic of the spring time's arrival. I have rave on about Voorhees Mall many a time, and every single time I pass by, I always pause to admire the trees. Fortunately, the weather has been quite lovely this spring season, and I do not have seasonal allergies. Given these opportunous circumstances, <a href="./about#oshawott">Oshawott</a> and I were able to capture the scenery with still images. The one snowy tree was also taken during the <q>spring</q> semester ironically enough! I think it is a nice juxtaposing contrast wedged between images of sunny trees on a warm spring day. It also serves as a divider between the <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/discover-rutgers/explore-our-spaces/college-avenue-campus" target="_blank">College Ave</a> trees and the <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/discover-rutgers/explore-our-spaces/cook-campus" target="_blank">Cook-Douglass</a> trees, being that it is the only image of a tree take on <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/discover-rutgers/explore-our-spaces/busch-campus" target="_blank">Busch Campus</a>. Unfortunately, Oshawott and I have overlooked the trees on <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/discover-rutgers/explore-our-spaces/livingston-campus" target="_blank">Livingston Campus</a>. If you do not want to make the same mistake as us, you should check out the <a href="https://ecopreserve.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">Livingston Ecological Preserve</a>, which you can read about <a href="./map#hike-profile">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the next time you walk by a tree in your city, I encourage you to take a moment to acknowledge its silent presence. Observe its enduring beauty, and contemplate its indispensable role in our lives. Reflect on its resilience amidst the concrete jungle, its ability to provide shade on a sunny day or its branches serving as a home for birds. Nature, in its many forms, is an integral part of our urban existence and deserves our acknowledgment and appreciation.
