				<h2 id="khyber" class="gallery-title">inside of khyber coffee &#38; tea</h2>
				<p>
					Khyber Coffee &#38; Tea is a cozy cafe located in downtown New Brunswick. I took these photos when visiting. The first two photos are of a small pot of hot chai, served with two petite glass cups. Interestingly, the kettle is placed on a metal circle that holds a candle underneath it, to maintain heat. For more details on Khyber, you can read my review of it <a href="./rev2">here</a>.

				<h2 id="harvest" class="gallery-title">phone eats first at harvest cafe</h2>
				<p>
					<a href="https://ifnh.rutgers.edu/harvest.html" target="_blank">Harvest Cafe</a> is a cafeteria located on Douglas Campus in the <a href="https://maps.rutgers.edu/#/?click=true&selected=6432" target="_blank">Institute for Food Nutrition and Health</a>. The food here is made fresh and right in front of you! The chefs exhibit their culinary talents here on a daily basis. Harvest offers a wide variety of delicious food from a frequently changing menu, ranging from noodle soups to freshly made smoothies. There are also prepackaged fresh sandwiches that you can take home to enjoy later. One meal swipe can get you an entrée with a side and a drink, or a smoothie with a side. Not only is the food from Harvest Cafe incredibly delicious, it is also quite aesthetically pleasing! The first image is from my first time at Harvest Cafe. I got <a href="https://www.cookwithmanali.com/palak-paneer/" target="_blank">palak paneer</a> as my entrée, with a chocolate cookie as my side and iced coffee to drink. My second meal at Harvest was lentils and rice, with an oatmeal raisin cookie and passion fruit iced tea. During my second visit, I also got the purple sky smoothie, which contains lots of berries and antioxidants.

				<h2 id="campuses" class="gallery-title">exploring different campuses</h2>
				<p>
					I love exploring the different campuses at Rutgers! Each campus has a very distinguishable vibe and offers unique experiences. My personal favorite is the <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/discover-rutgers/explore-our-spaces/college-avenue-campus" target="_blank">College Ave</a> campus, mostly because there are so many parties and good places to eat there! Below, the first image is from my <a href="./rev1">review</a> of the <a href="https://it.rutgers.edu/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-computer-labs/college-ave-computer-center-lab/" target="_blank">Academic Building East Computer Lab</a>. The second image is of a sticker that I discovered while walking around on <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/discover-rutgers/explore-our-spaces/cook-campus" target="_blank">Cook-Douglas</a> after eating at <a href="https://ifnh.rutgers.edu/harvest.html" target="_blank">Harvest Cafe</a>. The third one was taken on <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/discover-rutgers/explore-our-spaces/busch-campus" target="_blank">Busch Campus</a>, at the <a href="https://prcc.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">Paul Robe Cultural Center</a>, after a book club meeting with <em>Radical Reads</em>.

					These next four pictures were taken by me, Mew, spontaneously. The first picture below was taken near the <a href="https://www.campusreel.org/colleges/rutgers-university-new-brunswick/places/allison-road-classroom-building" target="_blank">Allison Road Classroom</a> building on <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/discover-rutgers/explore-our-spaces/busch-campus" target="_blank">Busch Campus</a>. As I was crossing the street, noticed the Hello Kitty sticker and snapped a quick picture of it. The second one was taken at the <a href="https://aacc.rutgers.edu/node/38" target="_blank">Asian American Cultural Center</a> on <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/discover-rutgers/explore-our-spaces/livingston-campus" target="_blank">Livingston Campus</a>. The movie in the background is <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81350338" target="_blank"><em>Badhaai Do</em></a>, a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank">Netflix</a> Original Bollywood rom-com. The third picture was taken in the basement of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/demaresthallevents/" target="_blank">Demarest Hall</a>. In the basement, there is a room covered in random art and these were some of my favorite pieces, which happened to be right next to each other. The last picture was taken at the intersection of Bartlett Street and <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/discover-rutgers/explore-our-spaces/college-avenue-campus" target="_blank">College Ave</a>. I thought it was interesting that the sign says “Melty Heart Ahead.”

				Oshawott captured this awesome picture of me resting in the nook of a tree at one of my favorite spots to hang out on campus: <a href="https://grid.rutgers.edu/voorhees-mall-xr-campus-tour" target="_blank">Voorhees Mall</a>. The large grassy area with climbable trees is the perfect spot to hang out with friends when the weather is slightly warmer than usual!

			<h2>photos from passion puddle</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/rutgers-passion-puddle-among-americas-most-romantic-college-spots" target="_blank">Passion Puddle</a> is a quaint pond right by the Red Oak Lane bus stop on the <a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/discover-rutgers/explore-our-spaces/cook-campus" target="_blank">Cook-Douglas</a> Campus. It is a scenic spot to enjoy nice weather and observe wild life. <a href="https://www.collegeranker.com/most-romantic-college-traditions/" target="_blank">College Ranker</a> ranked Passion Puddle at sixth place out of the top 25 most romantic spots on an American college campus. Legend has it that if you if you walk around the pond three times while holding hands with someone, you will fall in love with someone. The legend originated with specifically a man from <a href="https://catalogs.rutgers.edu/generated/nb-ug_0507/pg21608.html" target="_blank">Cook College</a> and a woman from <a href="https://douglass.rutgers.edu/news/100-years-douglass-college" target="_blank">Douglas College</a> in mind, and alleged that they would get married and live happily ever after. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Interestingly, Douglas College first started out as the New Jersey College Women in 1918 with 54 students and 12 books in its library. In 2007, it was renamed as <a href="https://douglass.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">Douglas <em>Residential</em> College</a>. Additionally, Cook College was renamed as the <a href="https://sebs.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (SEBS)</a>. Thus throughout the years, the narrative on  the romance of Passion Puddle has shifted to include couples at Rutgers that are not just a man from the obsolete Cook College and a woman from Douglas College.

				As our team's talented photographer, Oshawott has a keen eye for capturing stunning visuals that play a crucial role in bringing our project to life. Each image he takes carries a piece of our story, and his talent ensures that they are communicated effectively to our audience. His work is not just about clicking the shutter at the right moment. It's about understanding the story we want to tell and finding the perfect way to visually convey it.
