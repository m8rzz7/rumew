			This week’s Mew Review is on the Academic Building East Computer Lounge. As implied, the computer lounge is on the first floor of the Academic Building East, which lies between the Academic Building West and the Honors College. All of these buildings are located on the College Ave campus of Rutgers University-New Brunswick–which is not affiliated with RUMew. 
		</p>
		<p>
			One interesting quirk about the desktop computers here is that they are Mac computers with non-Mac keyboards. Because Apple loves to market itself as different from other tech companies, it is often incompatible or less compatible with non-Apple products. On Macs, keyboard commands require the unique Apple “Command” key instead of the <q>Ctrl</q> key. Unfortunately, the non-Mac keyboards in the computer lounge do not have the “Command” key, which can be slightly irritating. Fortunately, the desktops have lots of software that would be otherwise expensive to purchase out-of-pocket, such as Adobe Suite. Rutgers Students can access Adobe Suite from their own devices, but it uses a lot of storage. 
		</p>

			Another interesting feature of the Academic Building East Computer Lounge is that several times when I entered, the RUWireless Secure Wifi Network would not connect to my laptop, and I had to restart it. The Rutgers Wifi is notoriously unreliable, and its name, RUWirless <em>Secure</em>, is rather misleading. To access this network, one has to first connect to RUWireless, which redirects the user to a page to download the software to install RUWireless Secure on their device. Then, the user must log in and pray that the connection will be stable. Even when moving around from different locations on campus, the network gets spotty. Fortunately, the desktops in the computer lounge tend not to have network issues. 
		</p>

			Closing off on a more positive note, the computer lounge is in an excellent location. It is close to Voorhees Mall, where many students have classes and hang out when the weather is nice. It is also close to Cafe West in the Academic Building West. The two Academic Buildings connect on the first floor! Overall, the computer lounge is in a good location to get work done in between classes, print things, or utilize the software available on the desktops!
