			On a brisk and windy Monday afternoon, I stumbled upon a quaint cafe tucked around the corner off of George Street. Bushels of flowers dangled from the ceilings, matching the neat bouquets on each table. A banner with the expression <em>Ramadan Mubarak</em> (meaning <q>Blessed Ramadan,</q> a greeting shared during the <a href="https://ing.org/resources/for-all-groups/calendar-of-important-islamic-dates/ramadan-information-sheet/" target="_blank">holy month of fasting</a>) draped across the wall. As I approached the counter to order, I admired the delicious treats displayed behind a glass wall.

			This somewhat hidden gem of Downtown New Brunswick is known as Khyber Coffee  &#38; Tea House, and it is located at 110 Church Street. As stated on the <a href="https://www.drinkkhyber.com/our-story" target="_blank">cafe's website</a>, the name Khyber refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pass" target="_blank">Khyber Pass</a>â€”the same Khyber as referred to in <a href="https://youtu.be/nSWy2L5qVBM?si=Lp2X2o6Ch1Q77m2C" target="_blank"><q>Up the Khyber</q></a> by Pink Floyd (1969). This is a historically significant mountain pass that connects the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa" target="_blank">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</a>, a province of Pakistan, to Afghanistan and represents centuries of exchange in trade, culture, faith, and ideas. Interestingly enough, along the historical trade routes of the Khyber Pass, people often exchanged coffee and tea. The meaning behind the cafe's name is quite fitting.

			From my other visits here, I have noticed that the customers tend to gather in groups, whether that be families with small children, or graduate students studying for exams. The atmosphere is lively and welcoming. Khyber is open late most nights, and it can get very crowded and loud with laughter and overlapping conversations. My most recent visit was on a Monday afternoon around 1 PM, and the environment was much calmer, and there were fewer people.

			Khyber Coffe  &#38; Tea House is a bit of a walk from campus, but it is not too far. Additionally, like many places that <a href="https://www.drinkkhyber.com/menu" target="_blank">serve yummy drinks</a>, it can be a little pricy. It is important to note that this is a new, small, independent business, and unless like large corporate coffee shops, you can taste the care that goes into it. Overall, Khyber is an excellent cafe. The combination of fresh hot chai and cozy interior decoration is very comforting.
